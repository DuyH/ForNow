# For Now

## Screens
### Main Screen
You will see this as soon as you open the app
* new event button
* ignore list button
* list of events
** each event shows a title
** each event shows a tag
** each event shows a time
* Event Button - This is a dropdown from the Main Screen
** Event title
** Time
** Location (link that takes you to gmaps)
** Description (400 chars)
** tag(s)
** going button (checkmark)
** ignore button (>>)
### Ignore List
Get here from the main screen upper left and or right
* List of tags that you don't like
* each list item has an x button that takes it off the list
* dropdown to choose between alphabetical and chronological
### Creating event
Get here from the button at the top of the main screen
* Title with hinted text box
* Tags with autocomplete text box
* Time with text box
* Description with 400 char limit
* cancel button
* Do it button
** this may change later. The words will be different depending on the title that you input (e.g. freezetag will have a freezetag it button)

## Problems:
* Range
** Based off of time set. The range will determine who gets a notification.
** Location. Phone grabs your location every 5 min and then checks the database to see what events are going on within your range. Your phone gets the distance between your location and the location of the event and checks if it is within the range. If so, then the event is added to your list.
